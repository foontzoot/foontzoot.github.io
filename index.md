### Projects

#### User Profile & User Sync (LawPRO/TitlePLUS)

##### .NET Core • AWS • SecretsManager • API Gateway • Lambda • SQS • SNS • SES • Okta • Aurora (MySQL) • GitHub • GitHub Actions

Solved the issue of mismatched user profile information between LawPRO and TitlePLUS by introducing the `user changed event` Okta hook. Okta calls AWS API Gateway that invokes `Lambda -> SQS -> Lambda -> DB update -> SNS` flow. I also designed and created the `User Profile` section in the front-end React app that allows users to update their information.

AutoTrader had many old and unused orphaned assets, primarily images and videos, stored in Azure Blob Storage, Azure Table Storage, and Cosmos DB. I worked on a Durable Function that found those assets, backed them up to on-prem storage, and purged them from the Azure storage. This Durable Function had one central orchestrator and two sub-orchestrators. After the completion, we backed up and deleted more than 4.5 million orphaned images and videos from the storage. We also cleared several million entries in Azure Search Indexes. Unfortunately, I can't reveal the dollar amount saved.

##### ASP.NET 4.5 • MVC • FTP • Azure App Service • Azure SQL • Dapper • SQLServer • GitHub

Completed this project with ASP.NET MVC 4.5 to accommodate client's need for printing, fulfillment, activation and shipping of custom gift cards. The project was divided into several parts: fetching data and custom images, data manipulation for upload to the database, upload of images to the local database accessible by the printer, cards QA, data upload to client's FTP for activation, fulfillment, shipping and invoicing. Card proxy numbers were pre-loaded in our database. We used Azure App Service for hosting and Azure SQL with Dapper for data. Due to a printer limited networking abilities; we used local SQLServer 2008 for temporary image storage.

In the same process, I completely redesigned front-end GUI built in MS Access to a friendlier user experience using ASP.NET WinForms. During the upgrade, I created and optimized over 200 stored procedures and redesigned over 50 reports. Shipping/receiving tasks are 30% more efficient after adding barcode and QR Code enabled products tracking. In 2012, I converted the whole system from client/server type application to a 100% web-based system with no loss in productivity.
